# Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple project which utilizes the power of WebSockets. This was just my curiosity mainly around this technology and it's capabilities. Have fun exploring this repository.

# Is it better than any other Tic-Tac-Toe?
Absolutely. Let me provide you with a list of features that no other game has.

1. It's multiplayer, there's no AI whatsoever. Just send a link to one of your friends and have fun!
2. It's dynamic and exciting, and it also has a chat!
